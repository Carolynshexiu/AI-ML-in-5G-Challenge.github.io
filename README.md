The ITU AI/ML Challenge offers carefully curated problem statements, a mix of real-world and simulated data, technical webinars, mentoring, and hands-on sessions. Teams participating in the Challenge enable, create, train and deploy ML models for various domains including communication networks. This enables participants to not only showcase their talent, test their concepts on real data and real-world problems, and compete for global recognition including prize money and certificates, but also enter the world of ITU standards by mapping their solutions to our specifications.
Since the start of the Challenge in 2020, we have hosted more than xx competitions (problem statements). There are several Challenge categories that have been hosted until now including AI/ML in 5G Challenge, GeoAI Challenge, tinyML Challenge and AI for Fusion Energy Challenge.
